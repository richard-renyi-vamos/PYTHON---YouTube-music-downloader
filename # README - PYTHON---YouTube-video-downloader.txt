Creating a YouTube video downloader with a graphical user interface (GUI) involves a few steps. I'll guide you through building a simple one using Python with Tkinter for the GUI and pytube for downloading videos from YouTube.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the Required Libraries
You need two main libraries: pytube for downloading videos and tkinter for the GUI. You can install pytube using pip, and tkinter comes built-in with Python.

bash
Copy code
pip install pytube
2. Create the Python Script
python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
from pytube import YouTube

# Function to download video
def download_video():
    url = entry.get()  # Get URL from the input box
    if not url:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please enter a valid YouTube URL.")
        return

    try:
        # Download video
        yt = YouTube(url)
        video = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()  # Get the highest resolution stream
        video.download()  # Download the video
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", f"Downloaded: {yt.title}")
    except Exception as e:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Failed to download video: {e}")

# Create the GUI
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("YouTube Video Downloader")

# Input Label
label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter YouTube URL:")
label.pack(pady=10)

# URL Input
entry = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
entry.pack(padx=10)

# Download Button
button = tk.Button(root, text="Download", command=download_video)
button.pack(pady=20)

# Run the GUI
root.mainloop()
3. How It Works:
Tkinter is used to create the GUI with a simple input field and a button.
pytube downloads the YouTube video by getting the highest resolution stream from the provided URL.
After entering the YouTube URL, click "Download," and the video will be downloaded to the same directory as the script.
4. Run the Script
Once the script is ready, run it in your Python environment, and you'll get a window where you can paste a YouTube video URL and click "Download."

5. Further Enhancements
Progress bar: You can add a progress bar to show download progress.
Directory selection: Allow the user to choose the download location.
Video format options: Add functionality to let the user choose the video resolution or download as audio.
